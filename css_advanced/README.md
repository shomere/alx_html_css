# CSS Advanced Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Curriculum** and focuses on applying **CSS concepts** to create a visually appealing, responsive, and accessible webpage based on a **Figma design**.  
It builds upon the previous **HTML Advanced** project, adding styles, layouts, and design precision using only **HTML and CSS** (no external libraries or frameworks).

## Objectives
By completing this project, I aimed to:

- Understand and apply CSS fundamentals.
- Learn how to add and manage styles using external CSS files.
- Implement clean and maintainable CSS using classes and selectors.
- Apply CSS box model properties for layout and spacing.
- Compute and apply **CSS specificity** correctly.
- Reproduce a given **Figma design** with high accuracy.
- Understand how the browser loads and renders a webpage.
